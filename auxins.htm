              <span class="maintext">The term auxin is derived from the Greek 
              word auxein which means to grow. Compounds are generally considered 
              auxins if they can be characterized by their ability to induce cell 
              elongation in stems and otherwise resemble indoleacetic acid (the 
              first auxin isolated) in physiological activity. Auxins usually 
              affect other processes in addition to cell elongation of stem cells 
              but this characteristic is considered critical of all auxins and 
              thus &quot;helps&quot; define the hormone (Arteca, 1996; Mauseth, 
              1991; Raven, 1992; Salisbury and Ross, 1992). </span></font></p>

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>History of Auxins and Pioneering 
              Experiments</b><br>
              <span class="maintext">Auxins were the first plant hormones discovered. 
              Charles Darwin was among the first scientists to dabble in plant 
              hormone research. In his book &quot;The Power of Movement in Plants&quot; 
              presented in 1880, he first describes the effects of light on movement 
              of canary grass (Phalaris canariensis) coleoptiles. The coleoptile 
              is a specialized leaf originating from the first node which sheaths 
              the epicotyl in the plants seedling stage protecting it until it 
              emerges from the ground. When unidirectional light shines on the 
              coleoptile, it bends in the direction of the light. If the tip of 
              the coleoptile was covered with aluminum foil, no bending would 
              occur towards the unidirectional light. However if the tip of the 
              coleoptile was left uncovered but the portion just below the tip 
              was covered, exposure to unidirectional light resulted in curvature 
              toward the light. Darwin's experiment suggested that the tip of 
              the coleoptile was the tissue responsible for perceiving the light 
              and producing some signal which was transported to the lower part 
              of the coleoptile where the physiological response of bending occurred. 
              He then cut off the tip of the coleoptile and exposed the rest of 
              the coleoptile to unidirectional light to see if curving occurred. 
              Curvature did not occur confirming the results of his first experiment 
              (Darwin, 1880). <br>
              It was in 1885 that Salkowski discovered indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) 
              in fermentation media (Salkowski, 1885). The isolation of the same 
              product from plant tissues would not be found in plant tissues for 
              almost 50 years. IAA is the major auxin involved in many of the 
              physiological processes in plants (Arteca, 1996). In 1907, Fitting 
              studied the effect of making incisions on either the light or dark 
              side of the plant. His results were aimed at understanding if translocation 
              of the signal occurred on a particular side of the plant but his 
              results were inconclusive because the signal was capable of crossing 
              or going around the incision (Fitting, 1907). In 1913, Boysen-Jensen 
              modified Fritting's experiment by inserting pieces of mica to block 
              the transport of the signal and showed that transport of auxin toward 
              the base occurs on the dark side of the plant as opposed to the 
              side exposed to the unidirectional light (Boysen-Jensen, 1913). 
              In 1918, Paal confirmed Boysen-Jensen's results by cutting off coleoptile 
              tips in the dark, exposing only the tips to the light, replacing 
              the coleoptile tips on the plant but off centered to one side or 
              the other. Results showed that whichever side was exposed to the 
              coleoptile, curvature occurred toward the other side (Paal, 1918). 
              Soding was the next scientist to extend auxin research by extending 
              on Paal's idea. He showed that if tips were cut off there was a 
              reduction in growth but if they were cut off and then replaced growth 
              continued to occur (Soding, 1925). <br>
              In 1926, a graduate student from Holland by the name of Fritz Went 
              published a report describing how he isolated a plant growth substance 
              by placing agar blocks under coleoptile tips for a period of time 
              then removing them and placing them on decapitated Avena stems (Went, 
              1926). After placement of the agar, the stems resumed growth (see 
              below). In 1928, Went developed a method of quantifying this plant 
              growth substance. His results suggested that the curvatures of stems 
              were proportional to the amount of growth substance in the agar 
              (Went, 1928). This test was called the avena curvature test.(see 
              below) <img src="went1.gif" width="486" height="159"></span></font></p>
            <p><img src="went.gif" width="116" height="395" align="left"><font face="Arial"><span class="maintext">Much 
              of our current knowledge of auxin was obtained from its applications. 
              Went's work had a great influence in stimulating plant growth substance 
              research. He is often credited with dubbing the term auxin but it 
              was actually Kogl and Haagen-Smit who purified the compound auxentriolic 
              acid (auxin A) from human urine in 1931 (Kogl and Haagen-Smit, 1931). 
              Later Kogl isolated other compounds from urine which were similar 
              in structure and function to auxin A, one of which was indole-3 
              acetic acid (IAA) initially discovered by Salkowski in 1985. In 
              1954 a committee of plant physiologists was set up to characterize 
              the group auxins. The term comes from the Greek auxein meaning &quot;to 
              grow.&quot; Compounds are generally considered auxins if they are 
              synthesized by the plant and are substances which share similar 
              activity to IAA (the first auxin to be isolated from plants) (Arteca, 
              1996; Davies, 1995). </span><br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><b>Biosynthesis and Metabolism of Auxin</b><br>
              <span class="maintext">IAA is chemically similar to the amino acid 
              tryptophan which is generally accepted to be the molecule from which 
              IAA is derived. Three mechanisms have been suggested to explain 
              this conversion: <br>
              Tryptophan is converted to indolepyruvic acid through a transamination 
              reaction. Indolepyruvic acid is then converted to indoleacetaldehyde 
              by a decarboxylation reaction. The final step involves oxidation 
              of indoleacetaldehyde resulting in indoleacetic acid. <br>
              Tryptophan undergoes decarboxylation resulting in tryptamine. Tryptamine 
              is then oxidized and deaminated to produce indoleacetaldehyde. This 
              molecule is further oxidized to produce indoleacetic acid. <br>
              As recently as 1991, this 3rd mechanism has evolved. IAA can be 
              produced via a tryptophan-independent mechanism. This mechanism 
              is poorly understood, but has been proven using trp(-) mutants. 
              Other experiments have shown that, in some plants, this mechanism 
              is actually the preferred mechanism of IAA biosynthesis. <br>
              The enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of IAA are most active 
              in young tissues such as shoot apical meristems and growing leaves 
              and fruits. The same tissues are the locations where the highest 
              concentrations of IAA are found. One way plants can control the 
              amount of IAA present in tissues at a particular time is by controlling 
              the biosynthesis of the hormone. Another control mechanism involves 
              the production of conjugates which are, in simple terms, molecules 
              which resemble the hormone but are inactive. The formation of conjugates 
              may be a mechanism of storing and transporting the active hormone. 
              Conjugates can be formed from IAA via hydrolase enzymes. Conjugates 
              can be rapidly activated by environmental stimuli signaling a quick 
              hormonal response. Degradation of auxin is the final method of controlling 
              auxin levels. This process also has two proposed mechanisms outlined 
              below: <br>
              The oxidation of IAA by oxygen resulting in the loss of the carboxyl 
              group and 3-methyleneoxindole as the major breakdown product. IAA 
              oxidase is the enzyme which catalyzes this activity. Conjugates 
              of IAA and synthetic auxins such as 2,4-D can not be destroyed by

              C-2 of the heterocyclic ring may be oxidized resulting in oxindole-3-acetic 
              acid. C-3 may be oxidized in addition to C-2 resulting in dioxindole-3-acetic 
              acid. <br>
              The mechanisms by which biosynthesis and degradation of auxin molecules 
              occur are important to future agricultural applications. Information 
              regarding auxin metabolism will most likely lead to genetic and 
              chemical manipulation of endogenous hormone levels resulting in 
              desirable growth and differentiation of important crop species. 
              Ultimately, the possibility exists to regulate plant growth without 
              the use of hazardous herbicides and fertilizers (Davies, 1995; Salisbury 
              and Ross, 1992). </span><br>
