# phytohormones.info

This is a resurrection of the last known good copy of plant-hormones.info from the Internet Archive. The original domain seemed to lapse around mid 2014 and has been picked up by a domain squatter since. The new domain is the closest match I could find that was available.

## Changes

The original "Visitors Book" was a guestbook, an antiquated phenomenon of the early web, and consumed 99% of the 593MB in the archive so I removed it, including links within the site.

I've made numerous minor tweaks to the HTML to fix up links to images, etc.

## Scrape command:

```shell
gem install wayback_machine_downloader
wayback_machine_downloader -t 20140701100848 http://www.plant-hormones.info/
```
## Author

I believe it was authored by Paul Gaskin from [LARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Ashton_Research_Station) in Bristol, UK. If you have his contact details please pass them on.
