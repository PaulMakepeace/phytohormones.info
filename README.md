# phytohormones.info

This is a resurrection of the last known good copy of plant-hormones.info from the Internet Archive. The original domain seemed to lapse around mid 2014 and has been picked up by a domain squatter since. The new domain is the closest match I could find that was available.

## Changes

The original "Visitors Book" was a guestbook, an antiquated phenomenon of the early web, and consumed 99% of the 593MB in the archive so I removed it, including links within the site.

I've made numerous minor tweaks to the HTML to fix up links to images, etc.

## Scrape command:

```shell
gem install wayback_machine_downloader
wayback_machine_downloader -t 20140701100848 http://www.plant-hormones.info/
```
## Author

I believe it was authored by [Steve Croker](http://www.chemlabs.bris.ac.uk/bios/Steve_Croker.html) from [LARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Ashton_Research_Station) in Bristol, UK. Sadly, [he passed away](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2015/january/steve-croker.html) in December 2014. Given Mr Croker's obvious dedication to education I hope he would approve of his site's continuing benefit to the rest of us.
